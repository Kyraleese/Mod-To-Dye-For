And to all the folks behind ModLoader and MCP, without which I'd have had a much more difficult time getting this working!

Block IDs used:
251-254 (you can change these via the config)

Dyeable blocks:
Cloth, Cobblestone, Stone, and Wooden Planks
* For Cloth(Wool), please note you can still create the "default" dyed wools if you wish.

Installation instructions:

Install Modloader.  Make sure you remove the META-INF folder.
Place the .class files included in the zip file into your minecraft jar.
Place the terrain.png file included into your jar as well.

NOTE: If you wish to make this mod work with another texture pack, you will need to modify the texture pack's terrain.png file.  You need to add three new textures to the following slots:
226: Stone
227: Cobblestone
228: Planks

This mod *should* work with higher resolution textures so long as you have an appropriate mod like optifine installed to allow for the HD textures in the first place.  You'll still need to update the terrain.png file, however.
Please note that I have not personally tested this yet.
